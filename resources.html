                  What is the difference between dried cannabis and cannabis oil?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cannabis oils are the liquid substance extracted from the cannabis plant, while dried cannabis is the dried flowers of the plant. Cannabis oils
                  can be taken with a small glass of water, directly under the tongue, or in a meal or beverage. Vaporization of dried cannabis provides rapid effect lasting approximately one hour. The ingestion of cannabis oils can take up to two hours to take effect, though the duration of effect usually lasts a number of hours.

                  How are Kolab Project’s products tested?
                </p>
                <p>
                  To ensure products meet Kolab Project’s standard of excellence and certification, all products are laboratory tested and analyzed. For full transparency and accountability, each lot is then assigned a unique number and is tracked throughout the entire process. At every stage throughout production, we provide reports in accordance to all regulations under the Cannabis Act.

                <p>
                  Health Canada’s cannabis regulations set the requirements for product labels on cannabis. Each label includes:

                    <li>
                      Name and contact details of the producer

                  Medical cannabis is best stored in a secure, cool, dry and dark location.

                  Am I getting a license card to carry my medical cannabis?
                </p>
                <p>
                  You are not required to hold a license card to carry medical cannabis. You are allowed to possess up to a 30-day supply of dried cannabis or its equivalent, as specified in your medical document. The maximum amount of cannabis you are allowed to possess is 150g. Proof of your authorization to possess medical cannabis can be demonstrated by the client label on your medical cannabis container and corresponding photo ID.
